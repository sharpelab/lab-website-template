What a fantastic lab retreat! We spent two days at the mountain research station discussing our projects, brainstorming new ideas, and enjoying some much-needed downtime together.

The retreat included scientific presentations from each lab member, strategic planning sessions, and plenty of hiking and team-building activities. These gatherings are invaluable for fostering collaboration and building strong relationships within the lab.

Looking forward to implementing all the great ideas that emerged from our discussions!
