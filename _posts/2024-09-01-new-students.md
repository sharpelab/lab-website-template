We're thrilled to welcome three new graduate students to the Sharpe Lab this fall! Emma, Nathan, and Zack bring diverse backgrounds in computational biology, biochemistry, and biophysics.

Each of them will be working on exciting projects that advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms. We're looking forward to the fresh perspectives and innovative ideas they'll bring to our research.

Welcome to the team!
