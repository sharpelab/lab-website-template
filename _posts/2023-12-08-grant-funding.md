Excellent news! We've been awarded a new NIH R01 grant to support our work on protein-protein interactions. This funding will allow us to expand our computational infrastructure and support additional graduate students.

The three-year project will focus on developing new methods for predicting binding sites and understanding allosteric mechanisms. We're grateful for the continued support from NIH and excited about the research ahead.
