Emma successfully presented her research on membrane protein dynamics at the annual Biophysical Society meeting. Her poster drew significant interest from the community and sparked several potential collaborations.

The work demonstrates how molecular simulations can reveal previously unknown mechanisms of protein function. Great job Emma!
